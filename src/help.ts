${EXIT_CODES}`;

export const COMMAND_HELP: Record<string, string> = {
  login: `Usage: smstunnel login

Asks for your API key (hidden while you paste it), checks it with SMSTunnel and saves it:
in your macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager or Linux keyring (Secret Service) when there
is one, otherwise in a file only your user account can read.

Get a key in your dashboard: ${DASHBOARD_URL} → Apps → Add an app. It is shown only once.
To pipe it in instead: echo "$SMSTUNNEL_KEY" | smstunnel login`,

  logout: `Usage: smstunnel logout

Removes the saved key from this computer. The key keeps working until you deactivate or
delete it in your dashboard (Apps).`,

  phones: `Usage: smstunnel phones [--json]

Lists the phones linked to your account, which are online, and their ids for --phone.`,

  send: `Usage: smstunnel send <number> <message…> [options]

Hands a text to your phone, which sends it from your number. One number per text.
With no message, or "-", the text is read from standard input.

Options:
  --phone <id or name>  Which of your phones sends it (default: your default phone)
  --country <code>      Country code for a number written without + or 00, like +40
  --wait                Wait until your phone sent it (or it failed)
  --timeout <seconds>   How long --wait waits (default 120)
  --idempotency-key <key>
                        Run the same command again with the same key (within 24 hours) and
                        SMSTunnel gives back the first answer instead of sending a second text

Examples:
  smstunnel send +40712345678 "Your order is ready for pickup"
  smstunnel send 0712345678 --country +40 --phone "Store phone" --wait "See you at 10"
  echo "Backup finished" | smstunnel send +40712345678
  smstunnel send +40712345678 "Order 1042 is ready" --idempotency-key order-1042-ready

Texts go out in the order you send them, up to 1600 characters each. If none of your phones is
online, the text waits and goes out when one is back online (within 3 days).`,

  code: `Usage: smstunnel code <number> <message…> [options]

Sends a sign-in code you generated, from your own phone. The text must contain the code:
4 to 10 digits on their own (482913) or two groups of 3 joined by a dash (482-913), up to
320 characters. Codes have their own daily allowance.

Options: --phone, --country, --wait, --timeout and --idempotency-key, as for "smstunnel send".

Example:
  smstunnel code +40712345678 "Your sign-in code is 482913. It expires in 5 minutes."`,

  status: `Usage: smstunnel status <message-id> [--json]

Where a text is now: waiting for your phone, sent, or not sent (and why).`,

  received: `Usage: smstunnel received [options]

Texts your phone received after you turned on "Sync received texts" in the SMSTunnel app.
The key must be allowed to read them: in your dashboard, Apps → "Allow reading received texts"
(or "Can also read received texts" when you add the app).

Options:
  --since <when>        A date (2026-11-03, 2026-11-03T08:00:00Z) or a span back from now (30m, 2h, 1d)
  --from <number>       Only texts from this number
  --phone <id or name>  Only texts one of your phones received
  --limit <n>           How many, 1 to 100 (default 20)
  --watch               Keep printing new texts as they arrive (Ctrl+C stops)
  --interval <seconds>  How often --watch checks (default 10, at least 3)`,

  usage: `Usage: smstunnel usage [--json]

Your plan, how many texts and sign-in codes you used today and how many are left.`,
